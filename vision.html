                        <p>As part of my CareerFoundry program, I designed a responsive web app which allows users to search, save, message, and book event planners. Following the design thinking process, I started the project with preliminary research and problem definition, continued with prototype development and usability testing, and subsequently refined the visual design.</p>

                    <div> <!-- Project Process Empathize (Preliminary Problem Statement) -->
                        <p>The design process for The Vision app started by brainstorming possible problems in the event planning space.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Planning events demands many skills. <span>Event planning requires one to be budget & schedule conscious, an excellent communicator, detail-oriented, adaptable, and connected with service vendors.</span></li>
                            <li>Event planners are expensive. <span>Planners are commonly hired for big events with large budgets and significant guest lists.</span></li>
                            <li>Planning during the pandemic is complex. <span>It's challenging to know when and how to plan for an in-person, remote, or hybrid event.</span></li>
                            <li>Event planners are hard to find. <span>Those looking for an event planner need a reference or recommendation from a friend, family member, or coworker.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>With these possible problems in mind, I crafted a preliminary problem statement for The Vision app.</p>
                        <p>People tasked with organizing an event need a way to compare & hire professional event planners to help them coordinate their functions because event planning is not only time-consuming but also requires skills, connections, knowledge, and adaptability.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div> <!-- Project Process Empathize (Competitive Analysis) -->
                        <p>To further familiarize myself with the problem I identified two existing apps which allow users to find event planners: Thumbtack & Upwork. I studied how each company has already attempted to solve the users problem in their product and created a competitor profile for each. One of my take-aways from the competitive analysis was that both products had event planners as one of their many available services. Few focused solely on events which could be an opportunity.</p>
                        <p>Here is an example of the Thumbtack analysis.</p>
                        <div> <!-- Project Process Empathize (Competitive Analysis - Thumbtack Text) -->
                            <p>THUMBTACK:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>KEY OBJECTIVE   |   <span>Matches customers with local professionals. End-to-end booking experience for services. Encourages any type of professional/company to promote themselves to attract clients and grow their business.</span></li>
                                <li>OVERALL STRATEGY   |   <span>Free sign-up for customers & professionals. Any category of service offered in every region of the US. Professionals pay a fee for each customer lead created through the service.</span></li>
                                <li>MARKET ADVANTAGE   |   <span>1,100+ types of services with over 150,000 active professionals. Users find compatible professionals for their project via personalized search filters. App Score: 4.9 stars (165K ratings).</span></li>
                                <li>MARKETING PROFILE   |   <span>Breadth of services increase likelihood of repeat customers. Prominent position on Google search increases exposure. Limited advertisement on social media platforms.</span></li>
                            </ul>

                    <div> <!-- Project Process Empathize (Research Goals) -->
                        <p>Now that I had explored the existing problem space around event planning, my next step was to conduct user interviews which provided me the opportunity to directly learn about the needs, motivations, and frustrations from those that could potentially be my future users. </p>
                        <div> <!-- Project Process Empathize (Research Goals - Ordered List) -->
                            <p>Prior to drafting my script and recruiting participants I identified three primary research goals that I wanted to achieve in the interviews.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Uncover common challenges of planning an event or finding a planner.</li>
                                <li>Determine ways in which people find & evaluate planners.</li>
                                <li>Explore how the pandemic has impacted how people approach event planning.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div> <!-- Project Process Empathize (User Interviews & Analysis) -->
                        <p>Three individuals were selected for interviews given their specific experience and knowledge within various areas of event planning.</p>
                        <div> <!-- Project Process Empathize (User Interviews & Analysis - Participants) -->
                            <ul>
                                <li>Participant #1   |   <span>Corporate Conference Experience</span></li>
                                <li>Participant #2   |   <span>Personal Wedding Experience</span></li>
                                <li>Participant #3   |   <span>Non-Profit Event Experience</span></li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>The interviews were helpful in identifying methods of finding planners as well as hearing about expectations in client-planner relationships. To understand overall themes and connections in the data, I collected my notes and studied them via an affinity mapping exercise.</p>

                            <p>INSIGHTS:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Most participants said they find event planners through contacts in existing networks.</li>
                                <li>It can be challenging to plan events in destination cities which results in people relying on referrals by the venue.</li>
                                <li>Interviewees commonly referred to finding planners via Instagram or Yelp though that is not the primary purpose of those apps.</li>
                                <li>Reading reviews or receiving a referral is important to people when considering or evaluating planners for an event.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>With this user insight I was able to refine my preliminary problem statement for The Vision app.</p>
                        <p>Individuals tasked with organizing events need to find & hire planners to help execute their events because planning is time consuming and requires skills and connections.</p>

                                <p>Problem statement to be refined.</p>
                                <p>To establish the product my preliminary problem statement had to undergo a root cause analysis to identify a core problem. This was important as I wanted to design a solution for an actual need of the user. The early stages of the UX process fortunately encourages the refinement of the problem statement via competitive analysis and user interviews.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div> <!-- Project Process - Empathize (Learnings - Column 2) -->
                                <p>Planners are personal.</p>
                                <p>The Vision app will need to include sufficient information about the planner’s past experience and skills as well as ratings or reviews to make the user feel confident booking them for their event. That said, as discovered in my interviews the act of finding an event planner can also be personality driven and visual references are very important.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div> <!-- Project Process - Empathize (Learnings - Column 3) -->
                                <p>Let the user explain the problem.</p>
                                <p>Preparing questions was essential for my user interviews as it provided structure to the sessions. However, I learned to leave space for participants to offer feedback even when their responses weren't directly related to a prewritten prompt. These additional observations helped me to better understand their natural behaviors and motivations.</p>

                        <p>To begin this process, design personas were created per my user interview data. I developed 3 personas for The Vision: Simone, Jesse, & Dara. The intent of having multiple personas was to design for users searching for personal, professional, or non-profit events planners.</p>
                        <p>While additional information was included to make my personas memorable and relatable, the primary focus was on identifying user's motivations, needs, & goals and evaluating how those aligned with the preliminary problem statement.</p>

                        <p>With personas in hand, I started to visualize the tasks, thoughts, and emotions that my users would go through in order to accomplish a goal. This study was graphically represented in user journey maps.</p>
                        <p>As seen in the Journey Map below, Dara would like to find an event planner for her wedding. It is important to her that she can review photos of particular planner's past events in order to determine if they will be an appropriate or aesthetic fit for her event.</p>

                            <p>A benefit of creating Dara's Journey Map was that I was able to recognize a few design opportunities for The Vision app to help Dara more easily accomplish her goal.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bookmark feature to help users remember planners while in the search flow.</li>
                                <li>Album feature for a user's bookmarked planners that can be referred to later.</li>
                            </ul>

                    </div>
                    <div> <!-- Project Process Define (User Flows) -->
                        <p>The next part of the process required me to concentrate on specific actions the personas may be doing while using The Vision app. To create a user flow for Dara, I identified her objective, gathered information related to her task, and outlined an optimized list of tasks that I believed Dara would follow to accomplish her goal.</p>

                        <p>Defining my user personas, journeys, and flows as well as revisiting the problem statement helped me to get an idea of what product needs to be designed.</p>
                        <p>To start mapping out the organization and content of my product I created a preliminary site map. The hierarchy of The Vision app started with the home screen where the user could navigate to search, events, inbox, and account features.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Before starting to wireframe I conducted an open card sort to gain insight on my potential user's expectations for the organization of The Vision app. The following results are compiled from 10 participants sorting 20 cards via the website OptimalSort.</p>

                            <p>A few significant revisions to the preliminary sitemap came from the card sorting exercise with users.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Many participants grouped "Profile", "Save Profile", & "Share Profile" together while "Profile" was intended for the user's personal account and "Save Profile" & "Share Profile" were meant for features on an event planner's profile. For clarity, "Save Profile" & "Share Profile" were revised to "Save Planner" & "Share Planner".</li>
                                <li>Participants typically differentiated the planner cards from event cards. Thus, a "Planners" category, separate from the "Events" category, was added under the "Home Screen" on the revised sitemap which allowed for a more simplified process when users are searching, saving, messaging, and booking planners.</li>
                                <li>With the addition of the new "Planners" category under "Home Screen" the user is no longer required to save planners to specific events when they wish to bookmark a planner. As a result, the "Add New Event" option was omitted as events will now only be created once a user has signed a contract with a planner.</li>
                            </ol>

                                <p>Personal, corporate, and non-profit events differ in purpose, budget, or priorities. However, the people searching for planners of these various event types aren't drastically different from one another. I came to the realization that my personas have comparable end goals and could be synthesized into one primary persona given the project scope.</p>

                                <p>In reflection, my user journeys may be ambitious for a product that will reach MVP development. While the user journeys/task analysis helped to identify potential features and grasp persona flows, I first focused on the features users needed to accomplish their goal before entertaining what else I could provide in order to maximize my design effort.</p>

A product that has intuitive navigation and doesn't require people to relearn patterns will make for a more enjoyable experience.</p>

                                <p>Performing a heuristic evaluation of my product will be valuable in the future. However, as my design is in the early stages I used the excuse to heuristically evaluate a competitive app. The insight gained on how they attempted to solve the problem in their design and usability pros/cons discovered was a constructive reference once I started prototyping.</p>

                        <p>After completing the usability tests I had a substantial amount of data to analyze particularly as a majority of the participants opted to provided additional feedback after each task.</p>
                        <p>The first tool I employed to identify themes and connections in the information was an affinity mapping exercise in which I sorted the insight I gathered for specific tasks into the following categories: observations, positives quotes, negative quotes, errors, & rating.</p>

                        <p>While it was beneficial to recognize similarities and categorize themes in my usability test data by affinity mapping, I next applied structure and meaning to the insight by creating a rainbow spreadsheet. This allowed me to not only prioritize a list of errors that could be addressed but also start brainstorming possible solutions & next steps.</p>

                        <p>The insight I received from designers ranged from minor visual recommendations to more significant pain points. While addressing these items I also took the opportunity to review each screen to identify improvements that could be made in terms of accessibility.</p>

                                <p>HOME SCREEN:</p>
                                <li>SEARCH BAR FONT SIZE   |   <span>Search bar & icon increased for better readability.</span></li>
                                <li>SEARCH BAR LABELS/PLACEHOLDER   |   <span>"Planner Search" label added to input form to help user remember what to enter after selecting field in flow. "Example 'Party Planner'" added as placeholder text to help guide user on what is expected to enter.</span></li>
                                <li>HEADERS FONT CASE   |   <span>Headers (i.e. "Popular Services") changed from uppercase to title case to increase readability.</span></li>
                                <li>CARDS FONT SIZE/PADDING   |   <span>Planner cards (i.e. "Wedding Coordinators") & "Recently Searched" cards increased for better readability. Padding around text increased to give visual breathing room.</span></li>
                                <li>CARDS BACKGROUND COLOR   |   <span>"Recently Searched" cards lightened to increased contrast for better readability. "Featured Events" cards lightened as high contrast was drawing too much attention to that section and may distract user.</span></li>
                                <li>BADGE   |   <span>Color of "Inbox" icon notification changed to achieve contrast ratio of 3:1.</span></li>

                            <p>The next step after addressing errors discovered in the usability tests, refining the visual design via principles & collaboration, and investing in the practice of designing accessible interfaces for diverse users is to modify the prototype for handoff or another round of testing.</p>

                                <p>Design standards as inspiration.</p>
                                <p>Tools such as Google's Material Design were a handy reference when beginning the visual design. As I did not have an existing Style Guide it was beneficial to refer to it for best practices in the industry. However, I understand going forward they are purely guidelines and I have flexibility to evolve the product design as needed to best serve the users.</p>

                            <div> <!-- Project Process - Refine (Learnings - Column 2) -->
                                <p>Start with clean style guide.</p>
                                <p>I learned that I can design more efficiently if I strive for visual consistency and simplicity from the start of a project. In fact, the Style Guide I created could be streamlined and consolidated further. When working on MVPs in the future I will aim to make deliberate design decisions at the beginning of the process to avoid over complication later.</p>

                                <p>Make accessibility a priority.</p>
                                <p>Designing products for all users with a range of accessibilities should be a priority for designers. The modifications I made to address accessibility concerns (i.e. enlarging text size, modifying colors, and including labels) not only resulted in a product that more people can navigate but also added to the visual balance of the interface in general.</p>
